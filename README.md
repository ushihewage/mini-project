Project Overview
Credit card fraud detection is a critical application of machine learning in financial services. This project uses a dataset containing anonymized features representing credit card transactions and the corresponding labels indicating whether each transaction is fraudulent or legitimate. The goal is to train a model capable of accurately detecting fraudulent transactions.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project comes from Kaggle and contains the following key characteristics:

284,807 transactions
31 features (including time, amount, and anonymized variables)
Highly imbalanced, with only 0.172% of transactions being fraudulent
Modeling Approach
The following machine learning models were explored in this project:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
Gradient Boosting
Neural Networks
We applied various techniques to handle data imbalance, including:

Oversampling using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)
Class weighting
Results
The final model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score. Due to the class imbalance, special focus was placed on precision and recall for the fraudulent class. A confusion matrix was also used to visualize the model's performance.
